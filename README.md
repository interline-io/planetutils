## Features

Python-based scripts and a Docker container to work with planet-scale geographic data. Using PlanetUtils, you can:

- maintain your own copy of the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) planet (by applying incremental updates)
- cut your copy of the OSM planet into named bounding boxes (a.k.a., mini Mapzen Metro Extracts)
- download [Mapzen Terrain Tiles from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/) for the planet or your bounding boxes

PlanetUtils is packaged for use as a:

- Docker container, for use on any operating system
- Python package, for use on any operating system
- Homebrew formula, for use on Mac OS

## Installation

### Using Docker container

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed. Then:

```sh
docker pull interline/planetutils:release-v0.2.2
```

Any of the example commands below can be executed with `docker run`. It may be helpful to mount a local directory inside the container for persistence and to access output files.

- Example of using `docker run` with the `data` directory mounted as `/data`:

```sh
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/data:/data -t interline/planetutils:release-v0.2.2 <command>
```

### Using Homebrew on Mac OS

Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Then:

```sh
brew install interline-io/planetutils/planetutils
```

### Using Python package

If you want to install and use the Python package directly, you'll need to provide:

- Python 2.x
- Java
- [Osmosis](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis)
- [OSM C tools](https://gitlab.com/osm-c-tools/osmctools/)

Then clone this repo, run the tests, and install the Python package:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/interline-io/planetutils.git
python ./setup.py test
pip install .
```

## Usage

PlanetUtils supplies the following command-line utilities:

### osm_planet_update

Update a local OSM planet. For example:

```sh
osm_planet_update planet-latest.osm.pbf planet-new.osm.pbf
```

If `planet-latest.osm.pbf` does not exist, it will be downloaded, before applying updates.

By default, files are downloaded from planet.openstreetmap.org. Amazon Web Services also provides OSM planets through its Public Datasets program. To instead download the planet from AWS:

1. Make sure you have your [AWS credentials configured locally](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html).
2. Append the `--s3` flag.

Note that an entire OSM planet may be upwards of 40Gb in size!

For complete help on command-line arguments:

```sh
osm_planet_update -h
```

### osm_planet_extract

Cut up an OSM planet file into one or more extracts, defined by bounding boxes. Each bounding box is assigned a name. (This is like a mini version of Mapzen Metro Extracts!)

To create a single extract:

```sh
osm_planet_extract --outpath=data/osm_extracts --bbox=-122.737,37.449,-122.011,37.955 --name=san-francisco planet-latest.osm.pbf
```

To specify more than one bounding box of tiles to download, list the bounding boxes in a [CSV file](#bounding-box). For example:

```sh
osm_planet_extract --outpath=data/osm_extracts --csv=data/bboxes.csv planet-latest.osm.pbf
```

For complete help on command-line arguments:

```sh
osm_planet_extract -h
```

### elevation_tile_download

Download elevation tiles from the [Terrain Tiles in the AWS Public Datasets program](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/). Download for the entire planet, only tiles within a single bounding box, or within multiple bounding boxes.

To download the entire planet of tiles (__which will require about 1.6Tb of space!__):

```sh
elevation_tile_download --outpath=data/elevation
```

To download tiles to cover a single bounding box:

```sh
elevation_tile_download --outpath=data/elevation --bbox=-122.737,37.449,-122.011,37.955
```

To specify more than one bounding box of tiles to download, list the bounding boxes in a [CSV file](#bounding-box). For example:

```sh
elevation_tile_download --outpath=data/elevation --csv=data/bboxes.csv
```

For complete help on command-line arguments:

```sh
elevation_tile_download -h
```

### Bounding box CSV file format
<a name="bounding-box"></a>

When extracting multiple bounding boxes from an OSM planet, or when downloading multiple bounding boxes of elevation tiles, you can specify your bounding boxes in a single CSV file. Do not include a header row. The format is as follows:

```csv
[name for extract],[left longitude],[bottom latitude],[right longitude],[top latitude]
```

For example:
```csv
san-francisco,-122.737,37.449,-122.011,37.955
dar-es-salaam,38.894,-7.120,39.661,-6.502
```
